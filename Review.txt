Just bought this phone because it was availabe on sale on Amazon, to be honest for a smartphone which is 3 years old, it sure perform very well while playing high end games. The square edges is not very comfortable but it does make it look slick. Small screen is bit of a setback. even the battery life is less than couple of hours. only bought this phone because of brand and also i love IOS. for a mid-range device , cameras are little laggy as my expectation were little high from 12MP sensor. Decent experience tho.
